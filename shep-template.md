This is the suggested template for new SHEPs.

Note that an SHEP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your SHEP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `shep-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

The title should be 44 characters or less.

## Simple Summary
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SHEP. Imagine an email subject line, GitHub PR title, or forum post title.

## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the issue being addressed. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.

## Motivation
The motivation section should describe the "why" of this SHEP. What problem does it solve? Why should someone want to implement this initiative? What benefit does it provide to the SHIB ecosystem? What use cases does this SHEP address?
